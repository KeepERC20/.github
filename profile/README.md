To provide security and convenience without compromising decentralization, we propose KeepERC20, a distributed bank-and-wallet based on smart contracts and Chainlink Automation.

Currently, KeepERC20 offers three novel functions:

- Scheduled Transfer
- Recoverable Transfer
- Expirable Approval

We will continuously add more convenient and secure functions.

### Enjoy Decentralized and Secure Blockchain ❤️
